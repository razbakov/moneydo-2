# What is Kakeibo?

The Japanese tradition of using a kakeibo, which translates to “household finance ledger,” offers an easy solution to mindless spending habits. This budgeting system combines tracking purchases with the habit of mindfulness in order to reign in unnecessary spending and help you achieve savings goals.

The four category system helps kakeibo users become more mindful of their spending habits and avoid wasting money on things that don’t align with their goals.

A kakeibo is an excellent tool for those who are interested in minimalism. Its special attention to mindfulness separates it from other budgeting systems, making it a good match for those who want to ensure their money goes toward the things that bring joy to their lives.

Some benefits of kakeibo are:

- It simplifies finances by grouping spending into four distinct categories.
- It encourages realistic monthly savings goals.
- It pays attention to present, past and future.
- It encourages saving small amounts daily rather than occasional big sums.
- It celebrates small achievements.
